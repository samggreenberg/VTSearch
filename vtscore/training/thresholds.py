    """Split-conformal quantile threshold over held-out calibration scores.

    Maps ``inclusion_value`` to a decision threshold via quantiles of the
    calibration score distributions rather than a min-cost search over
    observed cuts.  The min-cost argmin this replaced had exactly as many
    distinct optima as the calibration set had ranking errors, so on
    well-separated votes (the common case) the threshold never moved with
    inclusion; quantiles move whenever the scores have any spread (see
    docs/experiments/inclusion-knob/REPORT.md and issue #2693).

    The rule, for ``k = inclusion_value`` (``BASE = CONFORMAL_BASE_BUDGET``):

    * A **false-negative cap** ``alpha(k) = min(1, BASE * 2^-k)``: the
      threshold never exceeds the ``alpha``-quantile of the calibration
      *positive* scores, so an estimated ``1 - alpha`` of true matches land
      at or above the cut.  ``+k`` therefore has a portable, user-facing
      meaning - "the fraction of true matches I'm willing to miss, halving
      per step" - independent of the dataset or detector.  The cap is an
      upper bound, not a target: when the classes separate cleanly the cut
      drops to the lowest calibration positive and the budget goes unspent
      (no match is sacrificed that the negatives don't force).
    * A **false-positive guard** for ``k <= 0``: the threshold stays at or
      above the ``1 - BASE * 2^k`` quantile of the calibration *negative*
      scores, so overlap-heavy tasks keep FPR control, and above a walk *up*
      the positive score distribution (``q_pos(k) = QPOS_MAX * |k|/10``: at
      -10 only the top-quartile-of-positives region remains - "just the
      surest matches").

    Every component quantile is monotone non-increasing in ``k``, so their
    min/max composition is too: the threshold is monotone non-increasing in
    inclusion **by construction**.  Raising inclusion can only grow the
    included set, and the sets are nested (everything included at ``k`` stays
    included at ``k + 1``) - which is what makes "cut off at Inclusion 1,
    verify up to Inclusion 4" a well-defined workflow.

    Args:
        scores: Held-out calibration scores, one per example.  Must come from
            data the scoring model did *not* train on; scores on the training
            votes themselves are optimistically separated and yield a
            too-tight band.
        labels: True binary labels (1.0 for good, 0.0 for bad),
            corresponding to ``scores``.
        inclusion_value: Integer in ``[-10, 10]``; higher includes more.

    Returns:
        A float threshold, always realizable within the calibration score

    Each ordering is a ``(cal_scores, cal_labels)`` pair: the fold model's

    labels.  Because :func:`train_model` is inclusion-independent, these
    orderings do **not** depend on ``inclusion`` - so they can be cached once
    and re-thresholded at any inclusion via :func:`threshold_from_fold_orderings`
    (and swept across all inclusions for the Stats chart).  See
    docs/plans/find-verification-workflow.md.

    wrapper must return (mirrors :func:`calculate_cross_calibration_threshold`'s
    historical early-returns); otherwise ``fallback`` is ``None``.

    *groups* activates the **bag-aware** path used when Bad votes are flooded
    into their region nodes: rows sharing a ``groups`` id belong to one voted
    image (a Bad bag's region negatives, or a single Good row) and

    are taken over *groups* (votes) not rows, fold fits are *weights*-balanced,

    inference scores an image by its best region.  When *groups* is ``None``
    (every non-flooded caller) the historical row-wise path runs unchanged.

    *score_rows_by_group* (grouped path only) maps each group id to the row
    stack that group should be **scored** over, decoupling "what the fold model
    trains on" from "what a calibration bag collapses to".  It exists because
    the two are not the same whenever a Good vote contributes fewer rows than a
    Bad vote floods: the Good bag then collapses to a max over 1 row while the
    Bad bag - and every image at inference - collapses to a max over N, and
    ``max`` is an upward-biased order statistic, so the calibrated cut
    lands systematically high and the threshold over-rejects positives.  Passing
    each vote's inference rows here puts both classes in the geometry and at the
    width the scorer will actually use.  ``None`` (every production caller)
    keeps the historical "collapse over the training rows" behaviour.

    Performs ``calibrate_count`` independent random Train/Calibrate splits.
    For each split, trains a model on the Train portion and scores the
    held-out Calibrate portion.  The pooled held-out scores then feed the
    conformal inclusion rule via :func:`threshold_from_fold_orderings`.

    Algorithm:
        For each of *k* = ``calibrate_count`` rounds:
        1. Stratified random split into Train (``1 - calibration_fraction``)
           and Calibrate (``calibration_fraction``).  Stratification guarantees
           the Train side has at least one of each class, so the per-fold MLP
           fit always has both-class supervision.
        2. Train a model on Train.
        3. Score the Calibrate portion.
        Pool the *k* rounds' held-out (score, label) pairs and apply
        :func:`conformal_threshold` at *inclusion_value*.

    Args:
        X_list: List of embedding arrays (one per labelled example).
        y_list: List of binary labels (1.0 for good, 0.0 for bad),
            aligned with ``X_list``.
        input_dim: Dimensionality of the embeddings.
        inclusion_value: Integer in ``[-10, 10]`` passed to
            :func:`conformal_threshold` to control the miss/false-alarm
            trade-off.  It does **not** enter model training (the fold models
            are inclusion-independent), so the same fold scores can be
            re-thresholded at any inclusion - see
            docs/plans/find-verification-workflow.md.
        rng: Optional seeded RandomState for reproducible splits. Falls back
            to the global ``np.random`` state when ``None``.
        calibrate_count: Number of random Train/Calibrate splits (default 2).
        calibration_fraction: Fraction of data used for calibration in each
            split (default 0.5).  For example, 0.2 means 80% Train / 20%
            Calibrate.  If the fraction is so extreme that a valid split
            cannot be formed (fewer than 2 training or 1 calibration
            examples), returns :data:`NO_GOOD_THRESHOLD` so that nothing
            is predicted as Good.
        hidden_dim: Force a specific hidden-layer width for the fold models.
            When ``None`` (default), each fold model auto-sizes based on its
            own training-set size.  Pass the full-data hidden dim to ensure
            fold models match the final model's architecture.
        score_rows_by_group: Per-group inference row stacks; see
            :func:`compute_fold_orderings`.  Grouped path only.

    Returns:
        A float threshold. Returns 0.5 when calibration is not possible:
        fewer than 4 examples total, or fewer than 2 of either class
        (stratified splitting needs at least one of each class on both
        the train and calibrate sides).  Returns :data:`NO_GOOD_THRESHOLD`
        (a finite sentinel above the sigmoid range) if
        ``calibration_fraction`` makes a valid split impossible.
